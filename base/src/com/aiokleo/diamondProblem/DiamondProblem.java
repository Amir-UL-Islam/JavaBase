/**
 * The Diamond Problem is a term used to describe a specific issue that arises in programming languages that support multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common superclass. Although Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes, it does support it for interfaces, and the Diamond Problem can still occur in interface inheritance.
