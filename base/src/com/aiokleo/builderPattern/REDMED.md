## What is Builder Pattern?
- The Builder Design Pattern helps us to slice the operations of building an object. It focuses on constructing a complex object step by step.
  - It also enforces a process to create an object as a finished product.
    - That means an object has to be massaged by some instructed steps before it is ready and can be used by others.
- Builder design pattern helps to hide the complex logic in the builder class.
