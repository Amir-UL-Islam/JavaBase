check method doesn't take any input string to process, it only takes a stack. To check if a given string is balanced, you need to pass the string as an argument to the Check method.

The Check method uses a Scanner to read input, but there is no input being provided. This will cause the Scanner to hang, waiting for input that never arrives.

The Check method scans for tokens using scan.nextLine(), but it never calls scan.nextLine(), so the loop will never run.

The OpenClose method checks if the input is "(", "{", "[", but the input is a string, not a character, so the comparison won't work as intended.

To fix these issues, you should remove the Scanner and pass the input string to the Check method. You can then use String.split to split the string into tokens for processing. The OpenClose method should also be modified to accept char values instead of String values."]})"
